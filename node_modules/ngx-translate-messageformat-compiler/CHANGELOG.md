## [2.0.1] - 2017-11-05

## [2.0.0] - 2017-10-22
### Added
- This CHANGELOG file.

### Changed
- The compiler creates its own MessageFormat instance instead of
  relying on the user to pass one via the constructor.
- Allow Angular up to v5 and ngx-translate up to v8 as peer
  dependencies. (#6)
- Use GitHub template for MIT license.

### Removed
- The `TranslateMessageFormatCompiler` constructor no longer takes
  a MessageFormat instance as a parameter. This simplifies the setup.
  Also, `messageformat` unfortunately does not provide Typescript
  types and therefore requires a minimal type declaration. Not
  exposing this to cosumers of the library saves potential headaches.
  This is obviously a breaking change. (#2)
- `TranslateMessageFormatCompiler` is no longer injectable. The
  `@Injectable` annotation isn't needed when used as recommended and
  the class was probably never injected, but it's still technically
  a breaking change.

## [1.1.1] - 2017-09-27
### Fixed
- Typo in package.json's repo url. (#1)
- Improved some words in README.

## [1.1.0] - 2017-09-27
### Added
- Check to see if (something that looks like) a MessageFormat instance
  was passed to `TranslateMessageFormatCompiler`'s constructor and throw a
  `TypeError` otherwise.

## [1.0.1] - 2017-09-27
### Fixed
- Fix npm release package by making sure the right files are included
  (and excluded) with `.npmignore`.

## [1.0.0] - 2017-09-27
### Added
- Initial release.
